# Capture-C Oligo Design
This work consists of two pipelines for Capture-C oligo generation.<br>
`Chromosome (https://github.com/jbkerry/OligoDesign/tree/master/Chromosome)`<br>
Generates oligos for an entire chromsome or block within a chromsome<br>
`Region ()`<br>
Generates oligos for user-supplied coordinates across the entire genome<br>
