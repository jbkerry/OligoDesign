Description
===========

If you run any of the other three modules as a pipeline, i.e. from the command line, you won't need to use the `tools` module as this is incorporated into the pipelines. However, the functions in `tools` are
listed below in case you prefer to run individual parts of the pipeline from a Python shell.
